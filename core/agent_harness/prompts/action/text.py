"""Shell action-agent system prompt text.

The stable base lives in ``opensre_system_prompt.md`` (loaded at import time)
so the long planner prompt is editable as data and packaged with the wheel.
That file is the OpenSRE action-planner contract (handoff vs investigation,
compound turns, slash mapping). Live execution checklists live in the
``update_plan`` tool plus ``planning_instructions.md`` — not a coding-agent
clone (no apply_patch / AGENTS.md spec).
