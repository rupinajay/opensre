"""The action prompt's prose tool catalog must agree with the tool registry.

``_SYSTEM_PROMPT_BASE`` describes ~19 tools in prose on the same call that
carries their JSON schemas. The prose is where the routing nuance lives ("use
``llm_set_provider`` ONLY when the user names an exact provider"), so it cannot
simply be deleted — but two descriptions of one tool drift, and the failure is
silent: the model is told to call a tool that no longer exists, or a new tool
ships with no routing guidance and is never selected.
